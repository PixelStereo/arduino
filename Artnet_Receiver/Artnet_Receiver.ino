ARTNET RECEIVER V3

This SCRIPT allows you to use arduino with ethernet shield or wifi shield and recieve artnet data. Up to you to use channels as you want.

Tested with Arduino 1.0.3, so this code should work with the new EthernetUdp library (instead of the depricated Udp library)

If you have implemented ameliorations to this sketch, please, contribute by sending back modifications, ameliorations, derivative sketch. It will be a pleasure
to let them accessible to community

For VVVV patchers, please think to put a mainloop node in your patch: minimum frame rate is 40fps with bulbs. But do not go too much higher ( max 100 fps).

This sketch is part of white cat lighting board suite: /http://www.le-chat-noir-numerique.fr  
wich is sending data to many different types of devices, and includes a direct communication in serial also with arduino likes devices
you may find whitecat interresting because its theatre based logic ( cuelist and automations) AND live oriented ( masters, midi, etc)

V3, modifications by David van Schoorisse <d.schoorisse@gmail.com>
Ported code to make use of the new EthernetUdp library used by Arduino 1.0 and higher.
